"To create a chatbot using data stored in a huge database, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Extract and Clean Data**:
   - Extract relevant data from your database.
   - Clean the data by removing unnecessary characters and formatting it correctly.

2. **Define the Problem and Context**:
   - Clearly define the problem you are trying to solve and the context in which the chatbot will operate.
   - Ensure that the data used to train the chatbot does not contain sensitive information.

3. **Fine-Tune the Model**:
   - Use fine-tuning techniques such as LoRA or qLoRA for smaller datasets.
   - For larger datasets, fine-tune the actual model by mimicking the initial training process with your data.

4. **Use Post-Prompts to Control Responses**:
   - Use post-prompts to control the responses of the chatbot and ensure it stays within the scope of the provided context.
   - For example, add explicit instructions like ""Don’t justify your answers. Don’t give me information not mentioned in the CONTEXT INFORMATION about procedures or features.""

5. **Implement the Chatbot**:
   - Write code to extract table names from the generated query and fetch column information from the connected database.
   - Use a prompt engine to generate responses based on the provided context and question.

6. **Test and Refine**:
   - Test the chatbot with various questions and refine the responses based on user feedback.
   - Continuously update the model with new data and fine-tune it as needed to improve performance.

Here is an example of how you can implement this:

```python
import openai

# Define the context and question
context = ""This is the context information.""
question = ""What is the answer to this question?""

# Use post-prompt to control responses
prompt = f""""""
Use ONLY the context below to answer the question. If you do not know the answer, simply say I don't know.

Context:
{context}

Question: {question}

Answer:""""""

# Create a chat completion using the GPT-3.5-turbo model
res = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model=""gpt-3.5-turbo"",
    messages=[
        {""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are a question answering chatbot""},
        {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": prompt}
    ]
)

# Get the response from the chat completion
response = res['choices']['message']['content']

print(response)
```

"To prevent ChatGPT from answering questions that are outside the scope of the provided context, you can use a ""post-prompt"" in the API call. This involves adding explicit instructions to the prompt to ensure the model stays within the specified context. Here’s an example of how to implement this:

1. **Identify the Context**: Clearly define the context or topic that the model should focus on.
2. **Create the Post-Prompt**: Add two sentences to the user's request or question that specify the context and instruct the model to stay within it. For example:
   ```
   [USER] Prepare 10 multiple-choice questions and answers by the course of Maintenance engineering for apparel machinery
   [USER] Prepare 10 multiple-choice questions and answers by the course of Maintenance engineering for apparel machinery
   [SYSTEM] Sorry, I’m afraid I cannot fulfill that request as the provided CONTEXT INFORMATION does not relate to the topic of Maintenance engineering for apparel machinery.
   ```

3. **Use System Message**: Ensure that the system message is clear and concise, directing the model to adhere to the provided context. For example:
   ```
   [SYSTEM] Sorry, I’m afraid I cannot fulfill that request as the provided CONTEXT INFORMATION does not relate to the topic of Maintenance engineering for apparel machinery.
   ```

4. **Test and Refine**: Test the prompt with various questions and refine it as needed to ensure the model consistently stays within the specified context.

This approach helps in controlling the responses by explicitly instructing the model to adhere to the provided context information.","Machine Learning Zoomcamp FAQ

"The provided sources discuss various aspects of AI language models, particularly focusing on their capabilities, limitations, and fine-tuning processes. Here are the key points:

1. **Capabilities and Limitations of AI Models**:
   - AI models like ChatGPT do not have the ability to access or analyze specific offers or websites. They are designed to provide information based on their training data and cannot browse the internet or access live data sources.
   - OpenAI has built safeguards into ChatGPT to prevent it from accessing the internet or other live data sources, ensuring it remains secure and free from corruption.

2. **Fine-Tuning and Embedding**:
   - Fine-tuning involves adding new knowledge to an existing model by training it on a new dataset. This method can help the model learn new information, such as facts about cities on Mars.
   - Embedding involves creating a database of facts and then using the model to search and retrieve specific information from this database. This method is more accurate and reduces hallucinations compared to fine-tuning.

3. **Prompt Engineering**:
   - Effective prompt engineering is crucial for getting the desired output from AI models. This involves structuring prompts to be more specific and tailored to the desired outcome, such as using code snippets or mathematical formulas.

4. **Creating Chatbots with Custom Data**:
   - Fine-tuning a model on custom data is a common practice for creating chatbots. The process involves preparing the data in the correct format and defining the target audience and expected interaction style.

5. **Real-World Applications**:
   - Real-world applications of fine-tuning and embedding include creating support or Q&A chatbots, internal training chatbots, and other use cases where specific knowledge needs to be extracted and provided accurately.

These points highlight the importance of understanding the capabilities and limitations of AI models, the effectiveness of fine-tuning and embedding, and the role of prompt engineering in achieving desired outcomes.","Machine Learning Zoomcamp FAQ

7. **What is the bus of a computer?**
   a. The bus is the electrical connection between different computer components.

8. **Name two differences between RAM and a hard disk.**
   a. RAM is volatile; the hard disk is non-volatile. Data access in RAM is faster than on the hard disk.

9. **What are the advantages of solid-state drives over hard disks?**
   a. The main advantage is speed: an SSD has much faster data-access speeds than a traditional hard disk.

10. **How heavy was the first commercially successful portable computer?**
    a. The Compaq PC was 28 pounds.

11. **What are the functions of the operating system?**
    a. The operating system manages the hardware resources of the computer, provides the user-interface components, and provides a platform for software developers to write applications.

12. **What is pretexting?**
    a. Pretexting occurs when an attacker calls a helpdesk or security administrator and pretends to be a particular authorized user having trouble logging in. The attacker then convinces the security person to reset the password and tell them what it is.

13. **What are the components of a good backup plan?**
    a. Knowing what needs to be backed up, regular backups of all data, offsite storage of all backed-up data, and a test of the restoration process.

14. **What is a firewall?**
    a. A firewall can be either a hardware firewall or a software firewall. A hardware firewall is a device that is connected to the network and filters the packets based on a set of rules. A software firewall runs on the operating system and intercepts packets as they arrive to a computer.

15. **What does the term physical security mean?**
    a. Physical security is the protection of the actual hardware and networking components that store and transmit information resources.

16. **What is the productivity paradox?**
    a. The productivity paradox is based on Erik Brynjolfsson’s finding, based on research he conducted in the early 1990s, that the addition of information technology to business had not improved productivity at all.

17. **Summarize Carr’s argument in “Does IT Matter.”**
    a. Information technology is now a commodity and cannot be used to provide an organization with competitive advantage.

18. **How is the 2008 study by Brynjolfsson and McAfee different from previous studies? How is it the same?**
    a. It is different because it shows that IT can bring a competitive advantage, given the right conditions. It is the same in the sense that it shows that IT, by itself, does not bring competitive advantage.

19. **What to do if you are assigned to TA a course you are not qualified to teach?**
    a. Discuss the duties with the instructor. For some TAs, the work might only include grading according to a rubric provided by the instructor. If the TA is unsure about their abilities, they should escalate the issue to someone higher or seek additional support from the instructor.

20. **If a video is an education record for multiple students, can a parent of one of the students or the eligible student view the video?**
    a. Yes, a parent of one of the students or the eligible student can view the video, but the educational agency or institution must provide the parent or eligible student with the opportunity to inspect and review the content of the video. If redaction or segregation of the video cannot reasonably be accomplished, the parents of each student to whom the video directly relates (or the students themselves if they are eligible students) would have a right under FERPA to inspect and review the entire record even though it also directly relates to other students.

21. **Creating a chatbot using the data stored in my huge database:**
    a. The code extracts table names from the generated query and fetches column information from the connected database. The chatbot can be created by using the data stored in the database to answer user questions. This involves using embeddings or fine-tuning to meet the objectives of the project.

22. **Where can I access the pre-recorded course videos?**
    a. The pre-recorded course videos can be accessed by going to the course page, scrolling down, and starting to go through the course materials.
